# 00 — Harness Sandbox and Supply-Chain Security (fg-34)

> **Owns:** status, ticket map, deferred scope, user decisions.
> **Not here:** requirements (`01`), design (`02`), verification matrix (`03`), file operations (`04`).

**Related code:** `OpenCodeClient`, `HarnessTicketProcessor`, `agent/Dockerfile`

## Why this ticket exists

Phase 1 runs OpenCode with `bash` access in a cloned repo on the agent container. Config deny-lists and prompt rules are not isolation: repo code, build scripts, tests and `npm install` lifecycle scripts can execute arbitrary code, reach the network, or read whatever the agent container can read.

## Deferred register (canonical)

Every deliberate omission and follow-up lives here exactly once. Status and
deferred scope are owned by this document; `01`–`04` link here.
